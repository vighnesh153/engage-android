# Engage Android - with improved DevX

Google is building an on-device surface that organizes users' apps by verticals
(like watch, listen, read, shopping, food, social, travel, health & fitness, and
others) and enables a new immersive experience for personalized app content
consumption.

In the initial phase, these set of libraries will contain support for Continue
Watching, Subscriptions and Recommendations. In future, if I am able to find
bandwidth, I will consider supporting other verticals.
